## 🟢 Phase 1: Understanding the Fundamentals (Weeks 1-3)
**Goal:** Build a strong foundation in functional programming concepts and how they apply to C#.

### 📖 Study:
📌 **Book References:**
- **Functional Programming with C# (O'Reilly, 2023)**
  - **Chapter 1:** *What Is Functional Programming?* (History, Benefits, and Core Ideas)
  - **Chapter 2:** *What Can We Do Already?* (Imperative vs. Functional Approaches)
- **Functional Programming in C# (Manning, 2018)**
  - **Chapter 1:** *Functional Programming Tenets* (First-Class Functions, Immutability, Side Effects)
  - **Chapter 2:** *Why Function Purity Matters* (Concurrency, Testability)
- **Functional C# (Packt, 2017)**
  - **Chapter 1:** *Tasting Functional Style in C#* (Transforming Imperative Code)
  - **Chapter 2:** *Walkthrough Delegates* (Understanding `Func<T>`, `Action<T>`, `Predicate<T>`)

### 💻 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Convert imperative C# code into a more functional style.  
✅ Use **immutable types** (`readonly`, `record`) and **LINQ** (`Select`, `Where`, `Aggregate`).  
✅ Create **higher-order functions** (functions that accept other functions as parameters).  

🔍 **Mini Project:**  
- Build a **simple calculator** using **pure functions** (no global state).

## 🟡 Phase 2: Core Functional Techniques (Weeks 4-6)
**Goal:** Learn how to write **pure functions**, work with **higher-order functions**, and handle **side effects**.

### 📖 Study:
📌 **Book References:**
- **Functional Programming with C# (O'Reilly, 2023)**
  - **Chapter 4:** *Work Smart, Not Hard with Functional Code* (Reusable Functions, Dictionaries, Iterators)
  - **Chapter 5:** *Higher-Order Functions* (Function Composition, Chaining, Mapping)
- **Functional Programming with C# (Packt, 2024)**
  - **Chapter 3:** *Pure Functions and Side Effects*
  - **Chapter 6:** *Higher-Order Functions and Delegates*
- **Functional Programming in C# (Manning, 2018)**
  - **Chapter 3:** *Function Signatures and Design*
  - **Chapter 4:** *Core Functional Patterns – Map, Bind, Where*

### 💻 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Refactor **existing methods** into **pure functions** (no side effects).  
✅ Implement **higher-order functions** to transform collections.  
✅ Use **delegates (`Func<>`, `Action<>`)** for abstraction.  

🔍 **Mini Project:**  
- Create a **data transformation pipeline** that:  
  - Reads data from a JSON file.  
  - Applies a series of transformations using **higher-order functions**.

## 🟠 Phase 3: Handling Errors and Managing State Functionally (Weeks 7-9)
**Goal:** Use functional techniques for error handling, state management, and avoiding null references.

### 📖 Study:
📌 **Book References:**
- **Functional Programming with C# (Packt, 2024)**
  - **Chapter 5:** *Error Handling – Railway-Oriented Programming (ROP)*
- **Functional Programming in C# (Manning, 2018)**
  - **Chapter 6:** *Functional Error Handling – Either, Validation, Exceptional Types*
  - **Chapter 9:** *State, Identity, and Change – Immutable Data Structures*
- **Functional C# (Packt, 2017)**
  - **Chapter 5:** *Querying Collections with LINQ* (Declarative vs. Imperative)
  - **Chapter 6:** *Asynchronous Functional Programming*

### 💻 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Implement **error handling without exceptions** using `Option<T>` and `Either<T>`.  
✅ Convert **mutating operations** into **pure functions** by using **immutable data structures**.  

🔍 **Mini Project:**  
- Implement a **user authentication system** that:  
  - Uses **functional error handling** instead of exceptions.  
  - Applies **Railway-Oriented Programming (ROP)**.

## 🔵 Phase 4: Advanced Functional Concepts (Weeks 10-12)
**Goal:** Apply **advanced functional patterns** like functors, monads, currying, and composition.

### 📖 Study:
📌 **Book References:**
- **Functional Programming with C# (O'Reilly, 2023)**
  - **Chapter 7:** *Functional Flow – Maybe, Bind, and Async Composition*
  - **Chapter 8:** *Currying & Partial Application*
- **Functional Programming with C# (Packt, 2024)**
  - **Chapter 7:** *Functors and Monads*
  - **Chapter 9:** *Currying and Partial Application*
- **Functional Programming in C# (Manning, 2018)**
  - **Chapter 8:** *Multi-Argument Functions with Applicatives*
  - **Chapter 11:** *Lazy Computations and Monad Composition*

### 💻 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Implement **monads (`Maybe<T>`, `Result<T>`)** to avoid null handling.  
✅ Use **currying** and **partial application** for function reuse.  
✅ Build **pipelines using composition** (`f ∘ g` instead of nested calls).  

🔍 **Final Project:**  
- Build a **functional order-processing system** that:  
  - Uses **function composition** to build workflows.  
  - Implements **Railway-Oriented Programming** for error handling.  
  - Uses **monads** to encapsulate operations.
