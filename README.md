  - **Chapter 7:** *Functional Flow – Maybe, Bind, and Async Composition*
  - **Chapter 8:** *Currying & Partial Application*
- **Functional Programming with C# (Packt, 2024)**
  - **Chapter 7:** *Functors and Monads*
  - **Chapter 9:** *Currying and Partial Application*
- **Functional Programming in C# (Manning, 2018)**
  - **Chapter 8:** *Multi-Argument Functions with Applicatives*
  - **Chapter 11:** *Lazy Computations and Monad Composition*

### 💻 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Implement **monads (`Maybe<T>`, `Result<T>`)** to avoid null handling.  
✅ Use **currying** and **partial application** for function reuse.  
✅ Build **pipelines using composition** (`f ∘ g` instead of nested calls).  

🔍 **Final Project:**  
- Build a **functional order-processing system** that:  
  - Uses **function composition** to build workflows.  
  - Implements **Railway-Oriented Programming** for error handling.  
  - Uses **monads** to encapsulate operations.
